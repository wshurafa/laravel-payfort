`Laravel Payfort` provides a simple and rich way to perform and handle operations for 
`Payfort` (MEA based online payment gateway) check here to read more <a href="http://www.payfort.com/">Payfort</a>.  
This package supports a set of `Payfort` operations as listed below, other operations are open for future work and 
contribution. 

* AUTHORIZATION/PURCHASE
* TOKENIZATION
* SDK_TOKEN
* CHECK_STATUS

You have to read the `Payfort` documentation very well before proceeding in using any package, the package author 
will not write about `Payfort` operations, what and how to use.
 
## Install

You can install `Laravel Payfort` package to your laravel project via composer command:
```
$ composer require wshurafa/laravel-payfort
```

## Configuration

#####  For Laravel < 5.5 (Package Auto Discovery : Skip the following two step for laravel 5.5+ )

After installing the `Laravel Payfort` library, register the `LaravelPayfort\Providers\PayfortServiceProvider` 
in your `config/app.php` configuration file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // Other service providers...

    LaravelPayfort\Providers\PayfortServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Also, add the `Payfort` facade to the `aliases` array in your `app` configuration file:
```php
'Payfort' => LaravelPayfort\Facades\Payfort::class,
```

After that, run the following command to publish the configurations file:
```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider "LaravelPayfort\Providers\PayfortServiceProvider"
```
 This will create a new config file named `payfort.php` in `config` folder. Then you have to add the following 
 constants in the `.env` file, you can find most of these values in your `Payfort` account. 
 ```
PAYFORT_USE_SANDBOX=true                      # Defines wether to activate the payfort sandbox enviroment or not.
PAYFORT_MERCHANT_IDENTIFIER=s2b3rj1vrjrhc1x   # The payfort merchant account identifier
PAYFORT_ACCESS_CODE=s31bpM1ebfNnwqo           # The payfort account access code
PAYFORT_SHA_TYPE=sha256                       # The payfort account sha type. sha256/sha512
PAYFORT_SHA_REQUEST_PHRASE=keljhgiergh        # The payfort account sha request phrase
PAYFORT_SHA_RESPONSE_PHRASE=lkejgoegj         # The payfort account sha response phrase
PAYFORT_CURRENCY=USD                          # The default currency for you app. Currency ISO code 3.
PAYFORT_RETURN_URL=/payfort/handle            # The url to return after submitting payfort forms.
 ```
 
## Basic Usage

Once all configuration steps are done, you are ready to use payfort operations in your app. Here is some examples on 
how to use this package:
 
 
### Authorization/Purchase request (Redirection)

To display payfort authorization or purchase page, in your controller's method add the following code snippet:
```php
return Payfort::redirection()->displayRedirectionPage([
    'command' => 'AUTHORIZATION',              # AUTHORIZATION/PURCHASE according to your operation.
    'merchant_reference' => 'ORDR.34562134',   # You reference id for this operation (Order id for example).
    'amount' => 100,                           # The operation amount.
    'currency' => 'QAR',                       # Optional if you need to use another currenct than set in config.
    'customer_email' => 'example@example.com'  # Customer email.
]); 
```
Other optional parameters that can be passed to `displayRedirectionPage` method as follows:
* token_name
* payment_option
* sadad_olp
* eci
* order_description
* customer_ip
* customer_name
* merchant_extra

configurations will be called.

return Payfort::redirection()->displayTokenizationPage([
    'merchant_reference' => 'ORDR.34562134',   # You reference id for this operation (Order id for example).

### Handling Payfort Authorization/Purchase response

#### Handling callback (return)

In your handling controller that handle the return url, you can simply use the `PayfortResponse` trait as follows:
```
use LaravelPayfort\Traits\PayfortResponse as PayfortResponse;

class PayfortOrdersController extends Controller{
    use PayfortResponse;
    
    public function processReturn(Request $request){
        $payfort_return = $this->handlePayfortCallback($request);
        # Here you can process the response and make your decision.
        # The response structure is as described in payfort documentation
    }
}
```

See [`Payfort` documentation](https://docs.payfort.com/docs/redirection/build/index.html#authorization-purchase-response) for more info.


#### Handling Direct Transaction Feedback

Same as handling payfort response except that you have to call `handlePayfortFeedback` instead of `handlePayfortCallback`
